## Data
- [ISIC2018](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018). The ISIC2018 dataset consists of images with skin disease lesions (2594 training images, 100 validation images, and 1000 test images).
- [NCP](http://ncov-ai.big.ac.cn/download?lang=en). Lesion segmentation dataset of the CT slice images from the China Consortium of Chest CT Image Investigation (CC-CCII). A total of 750 CT slices from 150 COVID-19 patients were manually segmented into background, lung field, ground-glass opacity (GGO), and consolidation (CL).
